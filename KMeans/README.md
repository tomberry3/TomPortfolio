### K-Means Clustering 

An Unsupervised Learning Algorithm

Unspervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, meaning that the data does not have explicit target labels or outputs associated with it. In unsupervised learning, the goal is to explore the inherent patterns, relationships, and structures within the data without the guidance of labeled examples.


Explanation
K-Means aims to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned centroids within a cluster. It's an iterative process that refines the clusters in each iteration to create more compact and cohesive groups of data points.


#### Data Frames/References
Using the scikit built in Model, data is extracted from the built-in dataframe, the [Iris Flower Data Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).
